# Voice of Customer Analytics üîé
Voice of Customer Analytics (VoC Analytics) is the process of collecting and **analyzing customer feedback** to understand their needs and wants. The feedback can be analyzed to identify trends, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. VoC Analytics can also be used to track customer satisfaction over time and to identify areas where the customer experience can be improved.

## What's in this project üíº
In this project, the customer feedback I analyzed was the review comments of customers from TripAdvisor of a restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand named *The House of Smooth Curry*

## Process
* **Tokenize Words:** Tokenizes the words in the data set, removing stop words and other unwanted characters.
  
* **Create Dictionary:** Creates a dictionary of words, mapping each word to a unique integer ID.
* **Gensim Corpus:** Creates a gensim corpus, which is a representation of the data set that is used by the topic modeling algorithm.
* **Topic Modeling:** Performs topic modeling on the data set, using the LDA algorithm. The LDA algorithm identifies 30 topics in the data set.
* **Visualize Result:** Visualizes the results of the topic modeling using pyLDAvis.


## Tokenize Words:
Starts by defining a list of Thai stopwords and removing them, which are common words that may not carry substantial meaning in the analysis. Additionally, a list of removed words is created, including whitespace characters and specific terms like '‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô' and punctuation.
