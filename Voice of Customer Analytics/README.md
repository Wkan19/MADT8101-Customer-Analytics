# Voice of Customer Analytics 
Voice of Customer Analytics (VoC Analytics) is the process of collecting and **analyzing customer feedback** to understand their needs and wants. The feedback can be analyzed to identify trends, pain points, and opportunities for improvement. VoC Analytics can also be used to track customer satisfaction over time and to identify areas where the customer experience can be improved.

## What's in this project
