# Customer Segmentation 🔎
Customer segmentation is where customers are grouped into distinct categories based on shared characteristics. It helps businesses tailor their offerings to meet the unique needs of each group, improving customer satisfaction and profitability.

## What's in this project 💼
I used Dataiku to explore and prepare the raw datasets, and then I used Python to conduct the segmentation by grouping the members based on their features.


* **Dataset:** [Customer Single View] 
* There are 4 provided datasets from a **Networking Business**: 1 data member dataset and 3 transactions between 2021 - 2023 (*but since transaction 2021 has some missing data, thus I don't use it*) and I used the data member dataset to **create Customer Single View in Dataiku**

## Process ⚙️
* **Notebook:** [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Wkan19/MADT8101-Customer-Analytics/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20and%20Product%20Recommendation/GitHub_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)
