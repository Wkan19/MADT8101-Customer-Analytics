Customer Churn Prediction is a data-driven process in which historical customer data, analytics, and machine learning techniques are leveraged to **forecast the probability or likelihood of customers discontinuing their association with a business or service provider**. This predictive modeling approach helps organizations proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted strategies to retain them, ultimately reducing customer churn rates and enhancing customer satisfaction.


## What's in this project üíº
In this work, I explored the E-Commerce Customer Dataset with *Churn Prediction* to determine the probability of customer churn. I did this by **exploring the data set, processing it, testing it with different classification models, evaluating the results, and exploring the feature importance**.

In this case, the customer I explored is a *non-contractual customer*, which means there is no clear end date for when the customer will actually churn.
